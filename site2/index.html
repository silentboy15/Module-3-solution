        <h2>Sherlock : Recreating the Sleuth</h2>
        <p>
          Arrogant. Witty. Genius. Sick. Loyal. Sherlock is simply one of the best TV series I've ever seen.
          Superb acting by both Cumberbatch and Freeman. Andrew Scott's portrayal of Moriarty was extraordinary. The supporting cast was also excellent. Molly's nervousness, Lastrade's frustrations, Irene's arrogance, Mrs. Hudson's hospitality, Mycroft's cool. They all seemed to fit in like pieces of a rather amazing jigsaw which you had no idea would produce such a brilliant image.
          The graphics were great.the thought process of sherlock shown in neat text was a great special effect.
          the soundtracks were melodic and provided the atmosphere of savoury mystery .the irene adler soundtrack creates imagery so emotional it can make a grown man cry.
          the character played by Cumberbatch is fitting .the messy hair ,uncaring attitude towards maintaining appearance is suggestive of a genius. Watson’s role as a sidekick is depicted perfectly.
          The deductions are mostly real. I used “mostly” because of the fact that some conclusions Sherlock makes in the series are unrealistic and depend on circumstances and in an ideal scenario,they would be correct.that’s not true in real life.but that's what makes a TV show a tv show.ideal conditions.
          It is geeky in a very specific way.
          It reflects a lifelong habit of thinking about people in rather rigid categories that are neither polite nor politically correct. Probably the British upper class are the only ones who can get away with it.
          Unlike House, Holmes is not being deliberately and knowingly offensive. He is oblivious
          The modern uptake on Sir Doyle's work was very comprehensive, and all of the episodes had an above average plot, with rarely a downside. All in all, except for one or two instances, all the episodes had a rather perfect plot to fill in for their respective series.
          I will wait for Season 4 and I will watch it. All I hope for is a glimmer of the old magic....I want Sherlock back.

        <h2>Dark : The Great Maze</h2>
        <p>
          The show’s intro as well as it's plot I based on the motto "Everything is Connected". But what is "everything"? Well it literally is everything involved in the creepy small town of Winden.
          The show is based on the concept of Time travel. Time is conceived as God here. If the concepts of Quantum entanglement, bootstrap paradox, wormhole, time travel, parallel universe fascinates you, then you’re at the right place. Although it is not necessary that you should know about all these to understand the plot.
          But what makes Dark more interesting is that it although having such a complicated storyline, the show has soul. Every character is emotionally polarizing.
          The show also poses some amazing philosophical questions..
          Dark is one of the shows that instead of resolving it's mystery brings more questions than answers in the second season. And it is getting better. The twists and turns get delightfully unpredictable as the plot progresses. And somehow the showrunners mangage to tie all lose ends by the series finale.
          The music does a perfect job.The theme music from Apparat's "Goodbye" sets the mood of the episode. The additional background scores produced by Ben Frost are way too awesome and enhance the heat of the moment. (Just like what Epic music Ramin Djawadi has created for Game of Thrones).
          There are moments where you'll feel emotional, there are moments where you'll feel thrilled and there are moments where you'll feel confused.
          These are the reasons which, I believe, make DARK different from any other series. It will keep you and your mind engulfed during the whole time and you’ll keep on thinking about it even when you’re not watching it. That’s the reason it is now being considered as one of the best series of all time!
          If you’re planning to start watching it now, go ahead and remember to keep a pen and a paper with you because you might end up making notes.

          <h2>Money Heist : Boom!</h2>
          <p>
           It is a good show, fun to watch, but you have to turn your brain off while watching it, since the show thinks it is much smarter than it is.
           It is a very well made show with writing at its peak, the character development is fantastically detailed and yet so subtle because you wont get to know their real names
           The twists are epic, the plots are believable and the acting of the heist gang members is so REAL.
           It is believable and unbelievable at the same time, the series looks realistic.
           It is by far one of the best paced shows, I've seen.
           The strategies and Plans used by Professor gave me multiple goosebumps. The best part of Money heist is that the Professor has everything worked out beforehand. Whenever the gang members face any situation, the scene goes back to the classroom where Professor explains on what can be done. Nobody could have played the better Professor. And you will fall in love with each and every character. I just love Berlin. He is the mastermind and he's theory and thoughts will make fall in love with him. And when he said "i will die with dignity " you will love him. He is an art. And ofcourse our beloved Professor. He is just awesome throughout.
           The show thinking it’s much smarter than it is.
           It’s all about Professor coming with ingenious plan, but it always has at least 10 unpredictable variables….which always go exactly as Professor predicted, even if statisticaly it’s not probable enough.
           This is a problem both in-show and among fans. In-show they are counting on public support, yet they kill a dozen police officers.
           “Bella Ciao” was sung by poor and truly oppressed people leaving their homes to fight occupiers, risking their lives to liberate their country. Now it is being sung by a fictional bunch of hundred millionaire criminals who fell in love with that.
